A repository for samples of code to help practice various programming languages.

# Greetings
Hi everyone, it's Osalotioman again. <br>
The guy that did [this](https://osalotioman.github.io/Lecture_Notes/index.html), along with contributions, support and assistance from those who can be found [here](https://github.com/Osalotioman/Lecture_Notes) and [here](https://github.com/Osalotioman/notes).

I've come up with another project. <br>
Have you ever thought to yourself, how about I run the code in my CSC211/CSC212 textbook/material, and you're probably too lazy to type it? <br>
Especiallly now that exams around the corner. 

*You're not alone!*

I've had those thoughts too.

Here's the main gist of the project. <br>
Those of us who have energy to type any of the programs in CSC212/CSC211 should upload their code to the [Code_Snippets_Repo](https://github.com/Osalotioman/Code_Snippets). <br>
Fortran code to the fortran folder/code, pascal code to the pascal/code folder.
The code will be made available on the [Lecture_Notes website](https://osalotioman.github.io/Lecture_Notes/i200lv/cs/index.html). <br>
Hence no need to type or retype the code when you can just visit the webpage, search for the code you need, copy it and do whatever you need with it.

More details on how to contribute can be found at the bottom of this page  [here](https://osalotioman.github.io/Lecture_Notes/i200lv/cs/index.html).

Ofcourse all contributions will be made through [github](https://github.com), unless in some cases where you can send someone else your written code to upload to github for you. <br>
Though for your contributions to be properly recorded I recommend it be done from your github account or your name be written in the comments of the code as the code writer.

For those who think github is just for programmers. <br>
*Wake Up* 

For those who don't know what github is or how to use it. <br>
*What are you waiting for?*
